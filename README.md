Login system for web application

My goal is to provide a secure login system for my next projects in order not to repeat my self.
Is a basic login system but i think is secure enough.

Pages:
- Login
- Register
- Forgot password
- Delete account message

Style is created with SASS and is very basic but flexible to changes after all.

- For database credential modify /login-system/config.php
- All the functionality of the submit buttons is written in /login-system/functions.php
- Modify the paths in various files to redict the user in your preferred page.
